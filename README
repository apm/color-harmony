This is a lightly modified version of the harmony sketching application
created by Ricardo Cabello.  It adds a color picker for setting stroke
and fill colors.

Harmony uses the MIT license:

It uses a preview release of YUI 3.1.0 to pull in the YUI 2.8.0 colorpicker,
delivered via the Yahoo! CDN.  It allows you to colorize the stroke style
for all of the brushes except 'chrome', and allows you to set the fill
color for the 'boxes' brush.

Some things that would make this even more interesting:

* sliders to specify transparency settings
* undo
* blend
* erase
